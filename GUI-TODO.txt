NASA-gamma todo:
1) API: 
	a) Add 3D plotting. Need to input detector and target positions.
	   Implement this on a separate window.
	
2) Spectrum:
	a) Add info and reset buttons. **DONE**
	b) Isotope ID - add 1) Baghdad Atlas (~2.2 MeV), 2) check sources.
	c) Isotope ID - add option to plot Compton edge. **DONE**
	d) Redo "Customize" so each window has its own OK button, and remove
	   multiple file upload. Make it a separate option under File -> Open multiple files. **DONE**
	e) When setting as "count rate", refresh spectrum. **DONE**

3) Advanced fitting:
	a) Activate button only when a region is selected.
	b) Fix left and right boundaries when using energy units.
	
3) Energy calibration:
	a) Add calibration equation with free parameters for repeatability. **DONE**
	b) Change to interactive table where individual points can be removed. **DONE**
	
4) Efficiency:
	a) Add uncertainty in activity and propagate errors.
        b) Implement second form of fitting function.
	
Suggestions / ideas:
- API: allow for file size reduction after filtering.
- Energy calibration: Allow for piecewise energy calibration.
